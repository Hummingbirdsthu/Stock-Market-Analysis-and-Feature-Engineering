# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Feature-Engineering

Developed a comprehensive analysis project involving multiple pandas DataFrames, each indexed by datetime. Each DataFrame contained stock codes with columns for buy/sell volumes and prices, capturing the closest and second closest match prices. Included a 'Price Volume' column reflecting the derivative price at each timestamp, closely related to the VN30 index.
